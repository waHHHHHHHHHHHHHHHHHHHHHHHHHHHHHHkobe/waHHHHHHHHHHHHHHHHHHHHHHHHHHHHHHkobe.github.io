  <h2 style="font-size:50px; text-align:center">elder mimmics, mimmics on steroids</h2>
  <p>elder mimmics are born when a normal mimmic has too much food and in which it will evolve like a pokemon and turn black and become stronger. the elder mimmic will gain more tough skin, the skin will only get stronger as the mimic consumes</p>
  <p>the mimic also grows a pale pink coat of skin on its face and its teeth sink down into its throat, its gums turn into a sharp boney beak, the darker coating allows it to blend seamlessly into dark rooms and at night</p>
  <p>the improved features make it the most formidable and efficient hunters on the planet so much so that they are called god's ultimate warrior, the perfect killing machine</p>
